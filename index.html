        <div class="paragraph2">
            <p>Human history is the narrative of humankind's
                 Since the invention of writing,
                 human history has been studied through 
                 primary- and secondary-source documents.
                  History was preceded by prehistory,
                   in the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age)
                   era and in much of the Neolithic (New Stone Age) era.
                    In Eurasia and North Africa, the Paleolithic and Neolithic
                     eras were separated by the Mesolithic era.<br>
                The Neolithic era saw the Agricultural Revolution
                 begin in fertile river valleys of the Near East 
                 around 10,000 BCE: humans began the systematic 
                 husbandry of plants and animals, and most humans 
                 transitioned from a nomadic life to a settled 
                 existence as farmers in permanent settlements. 
                 As efficient grain husbandry developed, surpluses 
                 fostered the development of advanced non-agricultural 
                 occupations, division of labor, social stratification,
                  including the rise of a leisured upper class, and urbanization.
                   The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems
                    of accounting and writing. True writing is first recorded
                     in Sumer at the end of the 4th millennium BCE, followed 
                     soon after in other parts of the Near East.<br>
                In the late Bronze Age, Hinduism developed on the Indian subcontinent
                 while the Axial Age witnessed the appearance of religions such
                  as Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism.
                   As civilizations flourished, ancient history saw the rise
                    and fall of empires. Subsequent post-classical history
                     (the "Middle Ages", from about 500 to 1500 CE) witnessed
                      the rise of Christianity, the Islamic Golden Age, and
                       the Renaissance (from around 1300 CE).<br>
                The 15th-century introduction of movable-type printing
                in Europe facilitated the dissemination of information, 
                hastening the end of the Middle Ages and eventually
                 enabling the Scientific Revolution.<br> The early modern period,
                  from about 1500 to 1800 CE, saw the Age of Discovery and the 
                  Age of Enlightenment. By the 18th century, the accumulation of 
                  knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that
                   brought about the Industrial Revolution and began the 
                   late modern period, which started around 1800 CE and continues.
                The foregoing historical periodization (antiquity, followed
                 by the post-classical, early-modern, and late-modern
                  periods) applies best to the history of Europe.<br>
                   Elsewhere, including China and India, historical
                    timelines unfolded differently up to the 18th century.
                     By then, however, due to extensive international
                      trade and colonization, the histories of most civilizations 
                      had become substantially intertwined. Over the last
                       quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of human populations,
                        agriculture, industry, commerce, scientific knowledge,
                         technology, communications, weapons destructiveness,
                         and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated.</p><br><br>
